🚀 **Self-Taught Junior DevOps Engineer | Part-Time Network Engineer**

I’m an engineering student with a strong foundation in **Linux, Docker, networking, and homelab infrastructure**.  
Most of what I know comes from hands-on experimentation, breaking things, fixing them, and doing it all over again.

## 🧠 My Journey

My DevOps journey started during my **twelfth grade**, when I first discovered **Docker and Linux** — wonderful concepts that completely changed how I looked at systems.

I deep-dived into these technologies and built my **first homelab** on a trusted old **Lenovo E41-25** (a true potato laptop 🥔).  
It served me well for almost a year before finally giving up.

In **2020**, during the COVID-19 lockdown, I had plenty of time to tinker, experiment, and learn deeply about Docker, Linux, and networking fundamentals.

After completing my **Diploma in Computer Science Engineering**, I upgraded my setup and built my **second homelab**.

Later on, I joined an **Engineering Degree Program**, where academic learning helped me better understand how systems and networks work under the hood.  
I still find myself wondering how machines and networks function so precisely the way they’re supposed to.

Along the way, an **angel investor gifted me a Raspberry Pi 4**, which further fueled my homelab and experimentation journey.

Now, in my **final year**, I’m working on my own project (as part of a team), backed by the strong foundation I built through years of homelab and networking experience.
